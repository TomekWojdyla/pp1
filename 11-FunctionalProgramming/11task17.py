#Save the list of employees in a string array. Then, write a program that displays people whose surnames start with the letter 'J'. Use anonymous and filter() functions. Sample result:
#employees = ["SMITH Lucy","JONES Janet","LEE Jerry",
#             "JACKSON Peter","JOHNSON Rick",
#             "LEWIS Terry","CLARKE Robin"]
#emp_J = list(filter(lambda e:e[0]=="J", employees))
# print a list â€¦ 
#...
#JONES Janet
#JACKSON Peter
#JOHNSON Rick

employees = ["SMITH Lucy","JONES Janet","LEE Jerry",
             "JACKSON Peter","JOHNSON Rick",
             "LEWIS Terry","CLARKE Robin"]

emp_J = list(filter(lambda e:e[0]=="J", employees))
print(emp_J)
