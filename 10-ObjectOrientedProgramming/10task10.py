#10.	Create a class that represents pieces of music. Define a class constructor that allows you to set the initial values of the music piece (artist, track title, album, year) when the object is created. Complete the class with the __str__ method returning the song data as a string, in the format as below (4 lines). Then, create two objects that represent two different pieces of music. Display these objects. Sample result:
#Performer: Ed Sheeran
#Song:      Hearts Don't Break Around Here
#Album:     Divide
#Year:      2017

class Music():
    def __init__ (self,artist, track title, album, year)
        self.artist= artist
