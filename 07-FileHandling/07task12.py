#12.	Create a program that saves in the student.txt file, in three separate lines, your name and surname, university name and field of study.  Tip: open a file in writing mode and use the write() method. Sample result:
# define personal data
#name = "Anna May"
#university = "Krakow University of Economics"
#field = "Applied Informatics"

# write to a file
#file = open("student.txt",â€¦)
#file.write(name+"\n")
#...
#file.close()

file=open("student_tw.txt", "w")
name = "Tomek Wojdyla"
univ = "Cracow University of Economics"
field = "Applied Informatics"

file.write(name+"\n")
file.write(univ+"\n")
file.write(field+"\n")
file.close()
